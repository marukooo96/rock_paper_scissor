        <h2>What is Mushiken?</h2>
        <p>Hello there! I'm pretty sure you are familiar with the game "Rock Paper Scissors", but what does it have to do with Mushiken? Well, Mushiken is actually the ancestor of Rock Paper Scissors, so to speak.</p>
        <p>This type of games played with three hand gestures, called "Sansukumi-ken" 三すくみ拳 in Japanese, originates from China and it's said the the earliest ken games were popularized in Japan by the Chinese community in Nagasaki.</p>
