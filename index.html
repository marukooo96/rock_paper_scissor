        <h2>What is Mushiken?</h2>
        <p>Hello there! I'm pretty sure you are familiar with the game "Rock Paper Scissors", but what does it have to do with Mushiken? Well, Mushiken is actually the ancestor of Rock Paper Scissors, so to speak.</p>
        <p>This type of games played with three hand gestures, called "Sansukumi-ken" 三すくみ拳 in Japanese, originates from China and it's said that the earliest ken games were popularized in Japan by the Chinese community in Nagasaki.</p>
        <p>But what does Mushiken actually mean? The name is composed by the Chinese characters 虫 (bug) and 拳 (fist). That is because instead of using rock, paper and scissors as element to mimic, this game hand gestures represent a slug, a frog, and a snake.</p>
        <p>In Mushiken, the frog represented by the thumb wins against the slug represented by the pinkie finger, which, in turn defeats the snake represented by the index finger, which wins against the frog, just like Rock Paper Scissors.<p>
